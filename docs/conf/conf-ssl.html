            RESTHeart comes with a self-signed certificate that makes straightforward enabling https.
        </p>
        <p>Specify <code>use-embedded-keystore: true</code> to use it (this is the default setting).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <p>
            Using the self-signed certificate leads to issues with some clients;
            for instance, with curl you need to specify the "--insecure" option or you'll get an error message.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use your own certificate you need to import it (and eventually the CA certificates chain) into a java keystore 
            and specify <code>use-embedded-keystore: false</code> and the <code>keystore-file</code>,<code>keystore-password</code> and <code>certpassword</code> configuration properties.
            Refer to the java keystore documentation for that.
