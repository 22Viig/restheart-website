    <h2>Static Resources</h2>
    
    <p>static web resources can be bound to an URL and served directly by RESTHeart</p>
    <p><code>what</code> is the path of the directory containing the resources; the path is either absolute (starting with /) or relative to the directory containing the RESTHeart jar</p>
    <p><code>embedded</code> is true if the static resources are embedded directly in the RESTHeart jar. In this case, the path must be relative to the jar root directory</p>
