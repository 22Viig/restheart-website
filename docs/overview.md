---

- __Zero development time__: just start it and the data REST API is ready to use
- __CRUD operations API__ on your data
- __Data model operations API__: create dbs, collections, indexes and the data structure
- __Super easy setup__ with convention over configuration approach
- __Pluggable security__ with User Management and ACL
- __[HAL](http://stateless.co/hal__specification.html)__ hypermedia type
- __Super lightweight__: pipeline architecture, ~6Mb footprint, ~200Mb RAM peek usage, starts in milliseconds,..
- __High throughput__: very small overhead on MongoDB performance
- __Horizontally scalable__: fully stateless architecture supporting MongoDB replica sets and shards
- Built on top of [undertow](http://undertow.io/) __non-blocking web server__
- Embeds the brilliant [HAL browser](http://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser) by Mike Kelly (the author of the HAL specifications)
- Support __Cross-origin resource sharing__ [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin__resource__sharing"CORS) so that your one page web application can deal with RESTHeart running on a different domain. 
- Ideal as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (or any other MVW JavaScript framework) __back-end__
