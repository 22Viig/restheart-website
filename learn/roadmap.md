## RESTHeart 4.0

Expected release date: Q1 2019

### Representation format

We received many feedbacks asking for a simpler representation format.

Starting RESTHeart 4.0 the HAL format will be abandoned.

#### root

```html
GET /

[ "db_1", 
  "db_2", 
  ...
  "db_n" ]
```

#### database

```html
GET /db

[ "collection_1", 
  "collection_2", 
  ...
  "collection_n" ]
```

#### collection properties (metadata)

```html
GET /db/_meta

{ "args" : [ ... ] 
  "checkers": [ ... ], 
  "transformers": [ ... ],
  "feeds": [ ... ] }
```

#### collection

```html
GET /db/coll

[ { <doc_1> },
  { <doc_2> },
  ...
  { <doc_n> },
]
```

#### document 

```html
GET /db/coll/docid

{ "prop_1": value,
  "prop_2": value,
  ...,
  "prop_n": value,
}
```

###Â Security

[uIAM](https://github.com/softInstigate/uiam) is a spin-off project from RESTHeart. It is a Identity and Access Manager that resembles and extends the security features embedded in RESTHeart 3.x.

uIAM will only focus on security while RESTHeart 4.0 will just provide a Web API for MongoDB in the spirit of having software bricks *that do one thing and do it well*.

uIAM follows the same dual licensing scheme of RESTHeart. Owners of RESTHeart pro and enterprise  licenses will get a commercial license for uIAM at no additional cost.

RESTHeart 4.0 will delegate security to uIAM and will not embed security functions anymore. 

### Changes feeds with Websocket

RESTHeart 4.x will fully support [change streams](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/index.html) introduced by MongoDB 3.6 for replica sets.

A new resource will be available, called `feed`. A feed can be created specifying a collection metadata that defines an aggregation and a URI in a similar way than an aggregation resource is currently defined.

The feed URI endpoint will open a *Websocket* for the client to be notified of updates on the aggregation result.

### Transactions

RESTHeart 4.x will fully support [multi document transactions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/#multi-document-transactions) introduced by MongoDB 4.0 for replica sets.

Following the REST paradigm, the approach to support transactions is modeling them as first class resources. 

The client can start a transaction:

```http
POST /_transactions

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Location: /_transactions/5bf58d909c5d125a2b9f0b86
```

Once a transaction has been created, requests can be executed under tis scope:


```http
POST /db/coll?txid=5bf58d909c5d125a2b9f0b86 {"a": 1}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

The transaction can be committed :

```http
PATCH /_transactions/5bf58d909c5d125a2b9f0b86 {"commit": true}
```

or rolled back:

```http
DELETE /_transactions/5bf58d909c5d125a2b9f0b86
```

## Plugin API changes

The java API for plugins (Transformers, Hooks, Checkers and Initializers) will undergo a refactoring aimed at simplify and clean the API with limited impact on existing implementations.
