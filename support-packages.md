## Coming back soon!

Due to the increment in companies asking for commercial services around RESTHeart, We are renewing our support offering and licensing scheme.

The commercial license grants using and embedding the latest major version of RESTHeart in commercial products, without the following limitations of the AGPL:

- Source code must be made available when the software is distributed.
- Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the software.
- Changes made to the code must be documented.
- Users who interact with the software via network are given the right to receive a copy of the source code.

Our support services aim to help the proper configuration, customization and deployment of the product in a production environment.

Please [send us an email](mailto:info@softinstigate.com?subject=RESTHeart commercial license and support) with any question.

Thank you.
