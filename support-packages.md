### Open-source edition

To get support for the open-source edition (under the terms of AGPL v3) here are the options:

- Open a specific product's issue on [Github](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/issues)
- Ask a general question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/restheart)
- Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/pulls) to contribute code or documentation.

### Commercial edition

Due to the increment in companies asking to buy commercial services around RESTHeart, we are renewing our support offering and licensing scheme.

The **commercial license** grants using and embedding the latest major version of RESTHeart in commercial products, without the following limitations of the AGPL:

- Source code must be made available when the software is distributed.
- Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the software.
- Changes made to the code must be documented.
- Users who interact with the software via network are given the right to receive a copy of the source code.

Our **development support services** aim to help the proper configuration, customization and deployment of RESTHeart in a production environment.

Please [send us an email](mailto:info@softinstigate.com?subject=RESTHeart commercial license and support) with any specific question related to commercial support and licensing.

Thank you.
