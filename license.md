# License

RESTHeart is distributed under the Open Source [GNU AGPL v3](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and a commercial license to effectively adopt it in the Enterprise.

Our goal in selecting the AGPL v3.0 as our open source license is to require that enhancements to RESTHeart be released to the community. Traditional GPL often does not achieve this anymore as a huge amount of software runs in the cloud. Besides, the AGPL v3.0 is the same license of MongoDB, so adopting it looks logical to us.
