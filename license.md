## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a License Key?

A *License Key* is a verifiable file, cryptographically signed by the Licensor, containing additional information on the License (including but not limited to those that specifies how many RESTHeart instances the Licensee is allowed to execute and how) that can purchased by the Licensee in order to acquire the rights to use RESTHeart.

### What is a RESTHeart instance?

A *RESTHeart instance* is any installation of RESTHeart and Derivative Works of RESTHeart capable of being executed as a single process in a production execution environment regardless the used technology, including but not limited to bare metal servers, virtual machines or containers. Installations made for testing or development purposes donâ€™t constitute RESTHeart instances.

### What is the License Key Activation process?

The License Key Activation is the technical process by which the Licensee accepts the Terms and Conditions of the License and binds the License Key to a RESTHeart Instance. RESTHeart instances with activated license keys run under the Commercial License and are not affected by AGPL restrictions.

### What is a Derivative Work?

A Derivative Work is the work or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the RESTHeart or modifications thereof, including but not limited to any modification of RESTHeart and any software that links or embeds RESTHeart. 

**Important**: A Software that interacts with RESTHeart only via its REST API is not considered as a Derivative Work.

### Can I distribute a Derivative Work with my own License?

With the Commercial License you can distribute your Derivative Work under your Terms and Conditions. This is also true if you distribute your Software as a Service.

You can buy as many license keys as the instance you need to distribute or even have an OEM license. In the latter case the License Key is not bound to RESTHeart instances and can only be used together with your product.

### Does the Commercial License overcome the *Disclose source* AGPL condition?

Yes, With the Commercial License you don't have to make the Source Code available when distributing your Derivative Work.
