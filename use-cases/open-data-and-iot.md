## Open Data and IoT


RESTHeart is a perfect fit for open data and solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Data can be uploaded to RESTHeart via JSON calls or CVS files and made immediately available through the REST API. Because RESTHeart eliminates the need for time-consuming integrations, in most cases you can set up your open data or IoT application without coding—saving significant development cost.

RESTHeart also leverages MongoDB's Geospatial support and stores GeoJSON objects without the need to write complicated server-side code: geometries are then available to clients such as Google Maps via its API.
RESTHeart also handles the GTFS format for public transportation schedules thanks to a commercial plugin.
Several RESTHeart users tell us that they had their mobile or web applications up and running in a single day!
