## What is the License Key Activation process?

## What is a Derivative Work?

A Derivative Work is the work or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the RESTHeart or modifications thereof, including but not limited to any modification of RESTHeart and any software that links or embeds RESTHeart.

## Can I distribute a Derivative Work with my own License?

With the Commercial License you can distribute your Derivative Work under your Terms and Conditions. This is also true if you distribute your Software as a Service.

You can buy as many license keys as the instance you need to distribute or even have an OEM license. In the latter case the License Key is not bound to RESTHeart instances and can only be used together with your product.

## Does the Commercial License overcome the *Disclose source* AGPL condition?

Yes, With the Commercial License you don't have to make the Source Code available when distributing your Derivative Work.
