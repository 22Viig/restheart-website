### Professional Services are provided by [SoftInstigate](https://www.softinstigate.com), the company behind RESTHeart.

Professional Services can help you on:

* Using RESTHeart' standard API (create resources, insert, update and query data)
* Developing RESTHeart extensions
* Customizing RESTHeart
* Priority bug fixing
* Validating architectural choices against best practices;
* integrations with other systems;
* Security configurations.
* Highly available deployments on cloud or on premises.

### Prepaid model

The Service can be delivered through a prepaid model.

* The service starts with a 80 working hours balance, valid for 12 months.
* When a task request is received, our team estimates the effort and, after customer's approval, executes the task.
* As soon as the task is resolved, the worked time is deducted from the balance.

At any time the Customer can:

* Top-up the balance, extending the service beyond 80 hours.
* Renew for additional 12 months.
* Request the current balance.

### T&M model 

We offer tailored T&M activities, for very specific needs, delivered in chunks of minimum 4 hours each.
